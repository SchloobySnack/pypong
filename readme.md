## PyPong: A simple pong clone

PyPong is a simple pong clone written in python.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**

   * Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can check by running `python3 --version` in your terminal. If not installed, download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   * Install the Pygame library using pip: `pip install pygame`

2. **Clone the repo:**

   1. Open a terminal & run the following command to clone the repo:

      ```terminal
      # git clone https://github.com/cschlue/pypong.git
      ```

   2. CD into the directory.
   3. Run the game using the following command: `python pypong.py`

**Gameplay:**

- Use your mouse to move the paddle at the bottom of the screen.
- The ball bounces off the walls and the paddle.
- Adjust the `x_speed` and `y_speed` variables in the code to control the ball's movement speed.

**Customization:**

- You can further customize the game by modifying the code:
  - Change the size and color of the ball and paddle.
  - Add sounds for ball collisions.
  - Implement scoring and a win/lose condition.

**Additional Notes:**

- This is a basic example, and you can expand it to create a more complex Pong game.
- Refer to the Pygame documentation ([https://www.pygame.org/docs/](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)) for more advanced features.
